# Dannys Diner SQL Data Analysis
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repository showcases my SQL data analysis project focusing on Dannys Diner. I explored customer spending habits, identified popular menu items, and mastered point calculations with multipliers. 

## Project Highlights

- **Total Customer Spending:**
  - Calculated the total amount spent by each customer at the restaurant.

- **Menu Analysis:**
  - Identified the most and first-purchased menu items, revealing popular choices among customers.

- **Membership Behavior:**
  - Explored customer behaviour around membership, including their first and last purchases before joining.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback. Happy coding! ðŸš€
